      # Review unstaged git changes for refactoring opportunities

      Run `git diff` to see all unstaged changes in the repository.

      # Analyze the changes

      Look through the diff output and identify refactoring opportunities such as:
      - Code duplication that could be extracted into shared functions/components
      - Overly complex functions that should be broken down
      - Poor naming that could be clarified
      - Missing type safety or loose typing
      - Dead code or unused imports introduced by the changes
      - Inconsistent patterns compared to the rest of the codebase

      # Apply refactors

      If you find refactoring opportunities, apply them directly to the code.
      Keep changes minimal and focused — don't refactor code outside of what was touched by the unstaged changes.
      Make sure the code still compiles and any relevant tests still pass after your refactors.

      # If nothing to refactor

      If the unstaged changes look clean, exit immediately.

      # Review unstaged git changes for bugs

      Run `git diff` to see all unstaged changes in the repository.

      # Analyze the changes for bugs

      Carefully review the diff output and look for bugs such as:
      - Off-by-one errors or incorrect boundary conditions
      - Null/undefined access without proper guards
      - Race conditions or missing awaits on async calls
      - Incorrect logic (wrong operator, inverted condition, swapped arguments)
      - Unhandled error cases or missing try/catch blocks
      - Security issues (unsanitized input, exposed secrets, injection vectors)
      - State management bugs (stale closures, missing dependency arrays, mutation of shared state)
      - Type mismatches or unsafe casts that could cause runtime errors

      # Fix bugs

      If you find bugs, fix them directly in the code.
      Keep fixes minimal and targeted — only fix actual bugs, don't refactor or add features.
      Make sure the code still compiles and any relevant tests still pass after your fixes.

      # If no bugs found

      If the unstaged changes look correct, exit immediately.

  tester:
    prompt-string: |
      # Run final tests

      Run the full test suite to make sure everything passes:
      - Run `npm test` (or the appropriate test command for this project)
      - Run `npm run build` to verify the project compiles cleanly
      - If there are linting scripts configured, run those too

      # Fix any failures

      If any tests fail or the build breaks:
      - Read the error output carefully
      - Fix the issues directly in the code
      - Re-run the failing tests to confirm the fix
      - Repeat until everything passes

      # Push to git

      Once all tests pass and the build is clean:
      - Run `git add -A` to stage all changes
      - Run `git diff --cached --stat` to review what will be committed
      - Write a concise, descriptive commit message summarizing the changes made in this iteration
      - Run `git commit` with that message
      - Run `git push` to push the commit to the remote

      # If nothing to push

      If there are no unstaged or staged changes (nothing was modified in this iteration), exit immediately.
