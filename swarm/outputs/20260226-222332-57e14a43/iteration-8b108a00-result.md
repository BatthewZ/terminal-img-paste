# Iteration 8b108a00: Review unstaged changes for refactoring

## Result: Nothing to refactor

The only unstaged changes are in build artifacts:
- `dist/extension.js` — minified bundle output
- `dist/extension.js.map` — source map

These are auto-generated files from `npm run compile`, not source code. No refactoring opportunities exist in generated output.

No changes were made.
