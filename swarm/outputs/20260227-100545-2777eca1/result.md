# Swarm Agent 5a8fb110 — Result

## Action Taken
Created feature file for **Phase 25: Image Preview Before Save** (P2 priority).

## File Created
`swarm/todo/phase25-image-preview-before-save.pending.md`

## Rationale
All P0 and P1 phases are complete (phases 1-24, 26, 27, 30). Phase 25 is the highest-priority remaining item (P2 — "Nice UX improvement"). It adds an opt-in preview step before saving clipboard images, letting users verify they're pasting the correct image.

## Remaining Unimplemented Phases
- Phase 28: Public extension API (P3)
- Phase 29: Diagnostic / debug mode (P3)
- Phase 31: Integration test harness (P3)
- Phase 32: Drag-and-drop support (P3)
