# Refactor Review — Agent c5766897

## Result: No refactoring needed

The unstaged changes contain no source code modifications — only documentation, configuration, and build artifacts:

- `.vscodeignore`: dev-file exclusions (clean)
- `README.md`: expanded docs (well-structured, no duplication)
- `package.json`: marketplace metadata (license, repo, keywords, banner)
- `dist/extension.js` + `.map`: rebuilt bundle
- Deleted completed swarm todo file

No TypeScript source was touched, so there are no refactoring opportunities.
