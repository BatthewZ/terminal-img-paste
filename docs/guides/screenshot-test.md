# playwright-cli

Use the playwright-cli instead of opening any other browser you've been told to use.
It acts as a browser but is faster than the other one you were told to use - so use it!

run `playwright-cli -h`

Use this to open up headless browsers and take screenshots of features working.

Take a screenshot of the relevant elements or pages, and analyze them to make sure they are visually as intended. Consider colour contrast, spacing, visibility, accessibility of elements and overall professional level design.

Always close browsers once finished.
